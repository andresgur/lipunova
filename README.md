# Accretion disk solver
Trying to solve the differential Equations from Lipunova+99 for all four types of disks:
Conservative and non-advective (the analytical Shakura & Sunyaev 73 thin disk solution)
Non-conservative and non-advective ("Slim" disk with Outflows analytical solution from Lipunova+99)
Conservative and advective ("Slim" disk without outflows, non-analytical solution, numerically solved)
Non-conservative and advective ("Slim" advective disk with outflows, non-analytical solution, numerically solved)
